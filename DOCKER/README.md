## About Docker
- Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the development, deployment, and management of applications using containers.  

- Containers are lightweight, standalone, and portable executable packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, libraries, and system dependencies.

- Docker ensures consistent environments from development to production, making it a popular choice for DevOps practices.
