# Frontend Setup

### Run the Application
1. Move to the Frontend Directory
Navigate to the frontend directory where the React code is located:

```bash
   cd /ems-ops-phase-0/react-hooks-frontend
```
2. Install Dependencies
Install all the required packages for the frontend application by the following command:
```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. The dependencies will be stored in the `node_modules` folder within the project directory.

## Run the Application
* Start the React application by running:
```bash
   npm start
   ```
* By default, the frontend will be accessible at port `3000`

### Solution:1 
Run the following commands 
```bash 
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
npm start
```
### Solution:2 
Navigate to package.json file

~/ems-ops-phase-0/react-hooks-frontend$
```bash
 sudo nano package.json
 ```
 Update `scripts` in the  `start`line
 ```bash
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
```
```bash
   npm start
   ```

#### Why Include --openssl-legacy-provider?

If you're using Node.js version 17 or newer, you may encounter issues related to cryptographic libraries in your React project. For example, libraries relying on older cryptography might cause the development server to fail with errors like "ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED".

By adding this flag:

* It ensures that your app runs smoothly by bypassing the OpenSSL 3.0 restrictions.
* You don't have to downgrade Node.js or modify your environment drastically

#### How to Check Your Node.js Version?
Run the following command in your terminal:
``` bash
node -v
``` 
If the version is 17 or higher, the --openssl-legacy-provider flag might still be necessary.
