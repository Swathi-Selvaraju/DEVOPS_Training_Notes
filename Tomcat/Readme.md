# Tomcat Setup, Deployment, and Maintenance Overview
This document outlines the tasks and responsibilities assigned to team members for setting up and managing an Apache Tomcat server. The tasks include Tomcat installation, application deployment, log management, and monitoring of server health.
# Prerequisites for System Configuration

## 1. Operating System Requirements

- Ensure the server runs on a compatible OS such as Linux (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) or Windows.
- Ensure the server has SSH access (for Linux) or Remote Desktop access (for Windows) for configuration.

## 2. User Permissions

- Access to a user account with sudo privileges (Linux) or administrative rights (Windows) is necessary to install software and configure services.

## 3. Java Development Kit (JDK)

- Tomcat requires Java to run. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) version compatible with the Tomcat version.
- Set up JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the JDK installation directory.
- `--To install JDK--:`
- Ubuntu: sudo apt update && sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
- CentOS: sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel
- Windows: Download from Oracle's website and follow the installation wizard.

## 4. Apache Tomcat Installation Files

- Download the 8.5.100 version of Apache Tomcat from the official website.
- Ensure the server has sufficient disk space for installation and deployment of the application.

## 5. Environment Variables

- Set the JAVA_HOME and CATALINA_HOME (Tomcat home directory) environment variables.
- Linux: Add these to /etc/environment or to your profile (~/.bashrc or ~/.profile)
- `export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java`
- `export CATALINA_HOME=/path/to/tomcat`
- Windows: Add these as System Environment Variables in System Properties.

## 6. Network Configuration

- Open the necessary firewall ports (typically port 8080 for Tomcat) to allow inbound traffic.
- Configure security groups and network policies if the server is hosted on a cloud provider.

## 7. Mail Server (for Notifications)

- Configure an SMTP server or email service to send notifications in case of Tomcat failures.
- Obtain SMTP credentials and test sending emails from the server to ensure connectivity.
- Install any necessary mail utilities like sendmail or mailx (for Linux).
  
## 8. Log Management Tool 

- Install logrotate on Linux for log rotation, or configure Tomcat's internal logging settings.
- Ensure enough storage for log files and archives.
  
## 9. Cron Jobs (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows)

- Set up automated tasks for monitoring and log rotation.
- Install cron (most Linux distributions have it pre-installed) for scheduling scripts, or use Task Scheduler on Windows.

# Tomcat Installation 

Task: Install Apache Tomcat on the designated server. Steps to Follow: Download the latest stable version of Apache Tomcat. Unzip the downloaded package and place it in the desired directory. Configure the environment variables (e.g., CATALINA_HOME and JAVA_HOME). Verify the installation by starting Tomcat and accessing the default page (usually http://localhost:8080). Expected Outcome: Apache Tomcat should be successfully installed and accessible on the default port.

# Application Deployment 
Task: Deploy the application on the Tomcat setup completed by Ranjitha. Steps to Follow: Obtain the application package in the .war format. Access the Tomcat server and navigate to the webapps directory. Place the .war file in the webapps directory; Tomcat should automatically deploy it. Confirm deployment by accessing the application through the designated URL. Expected Outcome: The application should be deployed successfully and accessible via the configured URL.

# Log Management and Monitoring 
Task: Set up log rotation, archiving, and monitoring of the Tomcat server. Steps to Follow: Log Rotation & Archiving: Configure log rotation for Tomcat logs to archive every hour. Use a tool like logrotate or Tomcat's built-in logging settings to manage this. Ensure archived logs are stored in a designated directory with timestamps. Monitoring & Email Notifications: Write a script to monitor the status of the Tomcat service. Set up a cron job to run the script every few minutes. If Tomcat is in a stopped state or fails to start, the script should send an email notification to the team. Set up email notifications using an SMTP server or a tool like sendmail. Expected Outcome: Logs should rotate and archive every hour, and email notifications should be sent if the Tomcat server fails or stops.
