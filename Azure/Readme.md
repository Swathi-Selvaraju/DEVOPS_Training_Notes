# Azure
Designed by Microsoft in 2010, Microsoft Azure is one of the widely used cloud computing platforms. Azure provides a wide variety of services such as cloud storage, compute services, network services, cognitive services, databases, analytics, and IoT. It makes building, deploying, and managing applications very easy. All the Microsoft Azure fundamentals are also described for a better understanding of readers.

## What is Azure?
- Azure is Microsoft’s cloud platform, just like Google has its Google Cloud and Amazon has its Amazon Web Service or AWS.000.
- Generally, it is a platform through which we can use Microsoft’s resources. For example, to set up a huge server, we will require huge investment, effort, physical space, and so on. In such situations, Microsoft Azure comes to our rescue.
- It will provide us with virtual machines, fast processing of data, analytical and monitoring tools, and so on to make our work simpler. 
- The pricing of Azure is also simpler and more cost-effective. Popularly termed as “Pay As You Go”, which means how much you use, pay only for that.
## How does Microsoft Azure Work?
- It is a private and public cloud platform that helps developers and IT professionals build deploy and manage applications
-  It uses the technology known as virtualization. Virtualization separates the tight coupling between the hardware and the operating system using an abstraction layer called a hypervisor.
-  Hypervisor emulates all the functions of a computer in a virtual machine, it can run multiple virtual machines at the same time and each virtual machine can run any operating system, such as Windows or Linux.

- Azure takes this virtualization technique and repeats it on a massive scale in the data center owned by Microsoft.
- Each data center has many racks filled with servers and each server includes a hypervisor to run multiple virtual machines. The network switch provides connectivity to all those servers.

## Types of Azure Services
- Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform which offers the following types of services:

    - Infrastructure as a service ( IaaS )
    - Platform as a service (PaaS)
    - Software as a service (SaaS)
