difference between laptop,virtual machine and container

|laptop |
-Runs a single OS directly on the hardware without virtualization.
-Limited by physical hardware specs (RAM, CPU, storage).
-Depends on hardware performance, generally fast with SSDs.
-Fully portable as a physical device.
-Ideal for running different OS environments on the same hardware, e.g., Windows on a Linux host.

|Virtual machine |
-Each VM runs its own OS, isolated from others on the same host.
-Requires significant system resources (RAM, CPU) as it includes an entire OS for each instance.
-Longer startup times due to the full OS boot process.
-VM images are portable but generally larger in size.
-Ideal for running different OS environments on the same hardware, e.g., Windows on a Linux host.

|Container|
-Shares the host OS kernel, providing lightweight isolation through namespaces and control groups.
-Lightweight, requiring fewer resources than VMs as it doesnâ€™t need a full OS per container.
-Fast startup due to shared OS kernel.
-container images are typically smaller, making them easier to deploy.
-Suitable for microservices and applications that require quick, scalable, and portable environments.
